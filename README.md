Cyclinderical Lithium Ion Spot Welder designed to be as cost effecitive as possible. Uses capacitors instead of battery, to reduce the pulse deration (dump less heat into the battery)

96 * Capacitors are 16V 10000UF (ebay or aliexpress around 40 USD for 100 PCS)
8 * IPLU300N04S4-R8 MOSFET (ebay or aliexpress 5 USD for 10 PCS)
2 * TC4422 9A gate drivers (ebay or aliexpress 3 USD for 5 PCS)
PCB -> 8 USD from JLCPCB

Requires external trigger source from MCU (PUSH PULL) 

Capacitors are to be solder about 10mm from PCB so extra solder can be added also 
bend the legs rather then trimming them
